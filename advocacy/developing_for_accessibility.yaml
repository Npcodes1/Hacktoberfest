  In this talk, we'll be talking about prioritizing accessibility when
  developing for the web. Despite what we envision, not every user is 100%
  comfortable as far as mental and physical capabilities go - and there's no
  excuse for ignoring that. Building an accessible product almost always leads
  to a much more well-architected product - so it's a win-win.
  We'll cover the tools and strategies you can use to aid users with visual,
  auditory, cognitive, and motor impairments. We'll discuss contrast, colors,
  content, keyboard flows, screen readers, section 508 - as well as skip menus,
  the accessibility tree, hover and focus indicators, ARIA properties, and more.
  There's a lot that developers and designers can do to aid users with
  impairments - so let's do it!
